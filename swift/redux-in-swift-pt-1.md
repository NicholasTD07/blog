## Redux 

Uni-direction data-flow

### WAT?

In essense, it's an idea which trys to

- seperate/isolate where changes can happen to the "State" of an app/program
- limits the flow of the data in an application

### What composes Redux?

Five types (of things) composes Redux:

- *State*, which could be anything
- *Store*, which holds a *State*
- *Action*, which gets dispatched to change the *State* in a *Store*
- *Reducer*, which combines the current *State* and the dispatched action and generates a new *State*
- *Subscriber*, which listens to changes of the *State* in a *Store*

### Why go with Redux?

> All data in an application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand.
