Uni-direction data-flow

### WAT?

In essense, it's an idea which trys to

- seperate/isolate where changes can happen to the "State" of an app/program
- limits the flow of the data in an application

### What composes Redux?

Four types (of things) composes Redux:

- Store, which holds the "State"
- Action, which gets dispatched to change the "State"
- Subscriber, which listens to changes in the "State"
- Reducer, which update the "State" according to the current "State" and the dispatched action

### Why go with Redux?

> All data in an application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand
