TL;DR

* [Swift-ZHI](https://github.com/NicholasTD07/Swift-ZHI): An open source Swift news reader App I wrote for ZhiHu Daily.

**Why**

* Learning iOS and Swift by doing it
* Wanted an App which allows me to save a daily news before reading it to avoid
  the loading screen (sometimes network SUCKS!)


**What**

* [SwiftDailyAPI](https://github.com/NicholasTD07/SwiftDailyAPI): A Swift API
  framework for ZhiHu Daily.
* [ZhiHu Daily](http://daily.zhihu.com/): A daily selection of highly rated
  questions and answers from ZhiHu (a Chinese Quora site)
* [ZhiHu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhihu): a Chinese question-and-answer
  site where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by the
  community of its users.
