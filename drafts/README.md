# Drafts

This is my WIP folder.

It's a place for
* Quick notes of some random ideas
* Polishing up half-cooked articles
* Testing ideas

## Workflow

* New drafts in its own branches `draft/this-is-a-test`
* After done, move it out to some other folder
  `swift/how-to-make-xcode-compile-faster`
* Create a PR
* Merge
* Launch! ðŸš€ (JK)
